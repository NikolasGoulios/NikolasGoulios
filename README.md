# Hey there, I'm Nikolas! üëã

I'm a tech enthusiast from Greece, now based in Finland, diving deep into the world of computer science. With a unique background in chemical and biotechnology engineering, I bring a solid analytical perspective and a strong passion for combining technology with creative solutions. Currently, I'm studying programming at Hive Helsinki, embracing collaborative, project-based learning with a peer-to-peer approach. My journey is all about refining problem-solving skills and pushing the boundaries of what code can achieve.

I'm working on multiple projects across coding languages, and I'm especially interested in **efficient code structure** and **self-built implementations** for deep understanding. If you‚Äôre into building cool stuff, exploring new ideas, or sharing coding tips, I‚Äôd love to connect!

### üíª Languages & Tools
- **C Programming**
- **GitHub** for version control and collaborative projects
- **Vim** for efficient coding and productivity
- **Notion** and **Obsidian** for documentation and personal knowledge management
- **MLX42** for graphics and visualization in coding

### üå± What I'm currently up to:
- **Fract-ol Project**: Learning complex graphics with MLX42, handling struct-based setups, and refining for modularity.
- **Libft Project**: Continuously improving my custom library with detailed documentation and a clean structure.
- **42AI** side project: Starting projects in Python, focusing on AI foundations.

### ü§ù Let's Connect!
Whether you're into coding, design, or tech in general, I'm open to connecting and learning from each other.
